The Dog Breed Code Quiz is a timed multiple choice quiz. Upon clicking the "Start Quiz" button, the user is alerted that there are 40 seconds to complete the quiz. Once accepted, the first question, image, and answers are presented to the screen. If the user selects the right answer, the quiz proceeds to the next question. If the user selects an incorrect answer, the quiz still proceeds to the next question but 10 seconds is reduced from the time remaining. This is repeated twice and then the game is over. Upon the game ending, an input box is presented and the user can save their initials. The entered initials, and the score are then saved to the Hall of Fame (which is a separate page).
